2. **Open** the project folder of a particular exercise (e.g. `01-basics`, `05-layouts`) in your code editor.

3. **Serve** the files
   You can open the HTML files directly in the browser, or run a static server (e.g. using VSCode Live Server or `npx serve`) to test relative paths and local assets.

4. **Inspect & Play**
